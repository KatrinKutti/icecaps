This task was great to practice Vue! 

Firstly my compilation was done step-by-step following the guidlines of the task. I wanted to make it as simple as possible for the customer
to use and make sure that customers have enough information about what should be filled out and what fields are optional.
I added an extra checkbox for the customer to confirm the subscription and to make sure that there is an extra alert about recurring payment, as this for me is 
quite important. The task was clear and the optional fields makes sence for marketing and analysis perspective. 
For me I couldn't automate the date of the first workday of the next month to automatically change accoring to the date of the subscribtion, therefore at the moment
the date has been hardcoded.
For me usability is good and clear and I think it is easy to use and understand. I would only like to make it more visually appealing (alignments of labels and 
input fields for an example). Partly used vuetify for better design.
